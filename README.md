## 💡 Topic Selection Background

  The elderly and disabled can face many difficult situations when they are home alone. Family may not be able to stay with them 24 hours a day. In the face of an aging society  where the number of elderly people is increasing, welfare environments for the elderly and the disabled should be provided. Therefore, we have developed a system that allows them to operate functionality in their house with simple hand movements and to escape from emergency situations.
